# QCHack
This is our project about IBM Creative Challenge!
Please find our code in the [`notebook`](https://github.com/peachnuts/QCHack/blob/start/Creative_challenge.ipynb) and the results in [`csv`](https://github.com/peachnuts/QCHack/blob/start/raw_result.csv) file!
## Steps 
1. We first create a simple circuit to show the impact of quantum interference.
2. Then, we demonstrate a show case of quantum interference using Simon's algorithm.
3. Finally, we implement our idea on the lines of ['Joy Vazirani']('https://www.jrussellhuffman.com/joyvazirani/') and convert our sample string "Qiskit" to musical tone.
